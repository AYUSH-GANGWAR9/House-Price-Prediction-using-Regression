# 📈 House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on size. It introduces fundamental **Machine Learning** concepts such as **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation**, and **visualization**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and normalizing data  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between variables  
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training a **Linear Regression** model  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**  
- **Prediction & Visualization**: Making house price predictions and plotting the regression line  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Google Colab (for execution)  
- Python 🐍  
- NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-Learn (Model Training & Evaluation)  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains house sizes (input) and corresponding prices (output). You can either upload your dataset or use a synthetic dataset generated within the notebook.  

## 📊 Results  
The trained model is evaluated using **MSE** and **R² Score**, and the regression line is visualized.
